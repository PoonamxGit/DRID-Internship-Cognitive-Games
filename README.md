# DRID Internship Projects – Cognitive Games 

This repository contains the cognitive-based games I developed during my **DRID Summer Internship 2025** at **Jaypee Institute of Information Technology**. These games aim to improve memory, attention, and problem-solving skills through interactive gameplay.

##  Games Developed:
1. [Pattern Recall Grid](./PatternRecallGrid) – A memory challenge game.
2. [Tower of Hanoi (Advanced)](./TowerOfHanoi) – A multi-level puzzle game with gesture control and leaderboard.
3. [Musical Maze](./MusicalMaze) – A level-based game combining platformer mechanics and music memory challenges.
